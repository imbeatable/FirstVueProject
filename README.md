# Building Progressive Web Applications with Vue.js

**Reliable, Fast, and Engaging Apps with Vue.js**

Building Progressive Web Application with Vue.js provides readers with necessary tools for developing a progressive web application (PWA). PWAs behave like a regular website and have similar structure to that of a web application. PWAs also have three additional extensions—a manifest file, an app icon, and service workers. Vue.js is a progressive framework for building user interfaces.

In each chapter, we are going to progress by building a library system, where we can manage our personal book library in a comfortable and portable manner. The book starts by explaining the concept of PWAs, its structure, and moves on to designing the App Shell and other features that distinguish a PWA from simple web pages. In the following chapters, the book deals with continuously evolving enriched web technologies such as Service Workers, Caching Strategies. Features that make PWAs powerful—such as Background Sync, Push Notification—are also covered in the last chapters.

Continuously evolving enriched web technologies (such as Service Workers) has allowed for development of sophisticated apps for mobile devices and extended these features to PWAs (i.e., web apps that feel like apps downloaded from app stores). This book addresses the vital need to study this technology and learn a little bit more about it.
